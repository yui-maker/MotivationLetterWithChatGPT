# MotivationLetterWithChatGPT
I’m not sure if it’s just me, but I absolutely dread writing motivation letters. Even when I’m super excited about a job or a study program, it feels like pulling teeth! Luckily, we have ChatGPT to save the day. There’s this handy tool where you can provide the web address of the company you want to apply to, and it’ll whip up a motivation letter for you. But let’s be real—don’t just copy and paste what ChatGPT gives you! Give it a little polish, add some of your own flair, and make it sound a bit more… human. Because who doesn’t love a touch of imperfection? Best of luck to all of us on this letter-writing adventure!
